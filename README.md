# Introduction
This started when I was doing a course on SQL 
https://www.edx.org/learn/relational-databases/stanford-university-databases-relational-databases-and-sql

I used the course to craft a model of an adressbook, should be simple enough right?

Then I wanted to explore creating web sites with Python, initially I wanted to use Django but I ended up starting with Bottle instead.
